## Project Overview

Enterprises generate massive volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, making insight extraction difficult.  
This project addresses the challenge by:

- Converting enterprise data into a structured knowledge graph  
- Enabling semantic search and question answering  
- Combining vector-based retrieval with graph-based reasoning  
- Providing an interactive dashboard for exploration and analysis
